/*
In order for an interval to intersect, s1<=e2 and s2<=e1
Now, if theyâ€™re intersecting, the interval in which they are intersecting is [max(s1,s2), min(e1,e2)]

The way we will implement the solution is by having two pointers A and B for traversing through the two lists, and once we find an intersection we will push it in our output vector and then to decide whether to increment A or B we will have to check their second value, i.e. if 
A = [0,2] and B = [1,5] the intersection will be [1,2] and now since the span of B(5) is larger than the span of A(2), we will increment A since there might be further intersections possible with B.
